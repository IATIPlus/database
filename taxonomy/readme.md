## Projects

Current projects under study and next projects of priority

### IATI Plus Ruleset and custom validator

Although IATI Plus is a graph database, data is aggregated in XML form. new information and reformatted information (in the case of unvalid or errors in IATI data) must comply with IATI's own ruleset, to the degree that it can.

### Graph Database Structure and Rules

On a foundational level, how should IATI Plus' graph database be structured?

### Taxonomy Conversion

IATI is an XML Standard. IATI Plus is a graph database. IATI standard and non-standard elements and attributes must be valid based on rulesets and guidelines. The project will establish guidelines around conversion and maintain a conversion table listing all existing and new fields.

### Experimental Taxonomies

IATI Plus is designed to handle IATI standard and non standard information. The following projects focus on thematic areas of particular interest to IATI Plus that require the expansion of IATI XML elements and attributes to include new information and functionality.
